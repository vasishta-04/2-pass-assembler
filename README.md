# 2-pass-assembler
Two Pass Assembler

-> Designed and implemented a two-pass assembler that translates custom assembly level code into efficient machine-level code in C++.

-> Built an integrated real-time emulator that executes the generated machine code, enabling immediate verification of assembly logic and performance.

-> Integrated a robust memory dump feature and line-by-line execution mode for real-time inspection of system memory, significantly enhancing fault detection and performance analysis.

-> Provided test cases:

    ◦  Number of roots for any quadratic equation.
    
    ◦  Nth term of an Arthematic Progression.
    
    ◦  Maximum element of an array.

    ◦  Sum of First N natural numbers.

    ◦  Sum of 2 given INTEGERS.
    
    ◦  Test case for Warnings.
    
    ◦  Test case for Errors.
